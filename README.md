# Features

### Text-based Narrative
Follow the daunting adventures of David and Cole, a father-son duo, as they navigate through a post-apocalyptic scene. Battle zombies, seek resources, and fight for your life through the choices you make throughout the game. Will the pair make it out safely, or will they meet their
demise in this zombie apocalypse?  

### AI Image Generation
Using modern AI Image Generation to supply the game with images of the story, each run of the game will harbor new and exciting images to help immerse the player into this zombie-infested world.
